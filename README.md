# YMKitX

**YMKitX** is a collection of tools which make app development *just a little bit* quicker and easier by taking care of a few specific scenarios.

## What’s Included
* **App Validation**: A simple but customizable anti-piracy solution based on app receipts. It may not defeat highly sophisticated tampering attempts, but it’s good enough.
* **Monitoring**: A flexible, modular mechanism for monitoring the app’s state at runtime: reporting errors, logging messages, and tracking user events. It offers customization options and drop-in support for any remote service (e.g. Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, etc.).
* **Miscellaneous**: Experimental, incubating, or unstable features which don’t belong to any other product (yet).
